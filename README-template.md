## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- As simple of a CSS structure as I could muster at this stage in my learning process
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

For the first time, I made a very conscious effort to structure my HTML and CSS files with simplicity in mind. Styles that were applicable to more than one element are grouped together.
I tried to not use a unique class for every single element in my HTML markup, if you have feedback on the topic of simplifying HTML and CSS even more, feel free to share!

I "copied" some insights from the previous frontendmentor project I did, without feeling guilty about structuring everything "from scratch". Using your previous experience and resources is
part of the learning process and, I believe, makes you a better developer.

### Continued development

It had been some time since I had lasted used media queries, since this is an essential part of creating responsive css, I would like to focus on this more in the future.
For this project, I tried to minimize using unique classes for every element, in which I think I succeeded for the most part. I do believe I can structure my html and css even more simply. I can
get away with it for smaller projects like this, but these ineffeciencies will become more clear once I tackle bigger projects.
